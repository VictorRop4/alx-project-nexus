# E-Commerce Backend – ProDev BE

This project is part of the **ProDev Backend Engineering program**. It simulates a **real-world e-commerce backend system**, focusing on scalability, security, and performance. The backend provides APIs for managing products, categories, and users, while supporting features like filtering, sorting, and pagination. It also emphasizes database optimization and API documentation, preparing learners for practical backend engineering challenges.

## 📌 Overview

The backend system handles:  
- **Product Catalog Management** – Create, update, retrieve, and delete products and categories.  
- **User Authentication & Authorization** – Secure endpoints using **JWT-based authentication**.  
- **API Features** – Filtering, sorting, and pagination to optimize product discovery.  
- **Database Optimization** – Schema design and indexing for high-performance queries.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **CRUD APIs** – Build APIs for managing products, categories, and users.  
- **Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination** – Efficient logic for product discovery.  
- **Database Optimization** – Design schemas and apply indexing to support seamless queries.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) – Scalable backend framework.  
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) – Relational database for structured, optimized queries.  
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) – Secure user authentication.  
- [Swagger/OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/) – For documenting and testing APIs.
